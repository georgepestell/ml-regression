# Machine Learning - Regression

Source file of my implementation of linear regression and logistic regression algorithms in Python.

See `main.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for main source code.

# Running

This project requires installing dependencies in `requirements.txt`. A virtual environment can help:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Then the dependencies can be installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the jupyter notebook through the command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the `main.ipynb` file.
